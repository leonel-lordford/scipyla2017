# Conference tracks

SciPyLA 2017 is the 5th Latin American conference on the applications in science of the Python
programing language.

The SciPyLA conference encourages submissions of three types of papers:

- Research and position papers: We encourage papers that describe work-in-progress
  or recently completed work based on the themes and goals of the different tracks or
  related topics, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom,
  raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.
  We will accept two types of papers: research papers up to 15 pages in length;
  and position papers up to 4 pages in length.

- Hypotheses papers: Hypotheses papers explicitly identify beliefs of the research
  community or mainstream industries about how a scientific technology and tools
  affect research practice. Hypotheses can be collected from mailing lists,
  blog posts, paper introductions, developer forums, or interviews.
  Papers should clearly document the source(s) of each hypothesis and discuss the
  importance, use, and relevance of the hypotheses on research or practice.
  Papers may also, but are not required to, review evidence for or against the
  hypotheses identified. Hypotheses papers can be up to 4 pages in length.

- Review articles: Review articles summarize the current state
  of understanding on a topic. A review article surveys and summarizes previously
  published studies, rather than reporting new facts or analysis. The conference
  encourages submission of industrial experience and tool demonstrations in this
  category. Review articles can be up to 10 pages in length.
  Review Articles teach about: 
  * the main people working in a field
  * recent major advances and discoveries
  * significant gaps in the research
  * current debates
  * ideas of where research might go next

Research papers will be judged for technical novelty and scientific merit.
Any previous publication in any form must be explicitly identified and
cited on the first page of the submission. Papers in all other categories
will be judged on novelty, clarity, accessibility, and suitability for a
high quality presentation and discussion at the workshop.

Submissions may be accompanied by data papers and video papers complementing
the subjects discussed.
